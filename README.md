# Blacklist Project
## Intention
Blacklist is a tool for gathering and publish information about malicious IP addresses i.e. addresses whish used by attackers for various bad actions: IP flooding, brut force attacks etc.

Published lists can be used in network devices for blocking access to published IP addresses

Addresses information should be gathered by agents, agents provide actual information to addresses storage.
So we have always actual information about attackers and can block their activity on Interner connected devices with black listing.
